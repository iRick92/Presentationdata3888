.left[
- Short term graft success (less than one year) in Australia is 90%, one of the highest in the world.
- However in the long term, proportion of patient who develops graft rejection is high

## .white[Introducing the KTMT]

.left[
The Kidney Tranplantation Metric Tool is being designed to aid doctors and health professionals in predicting the long term Kidney graft rejection.
The KTMT has two components:
1. Eplet and HLA mismatch prediction Tool
The first component utilizes several metrics derived from the survival analysis of Eplet, HLA and DSA data.

2. Gene Expression prediction Tool
The second component utilizes microanalysis of gene expression data.

#### .white[Survival Analysis of Eplet, HLA and DSA data.]

- Model of DSA activation and time for class 1 eplets
- Model of DSA activation and time for class 2 eplets
- Model of preidciting any type of acute rejection utilising core eplet data and HLA mismatches 
- Model of predicting any type of acute rejection utilising core eplet data and eplet mismatches 
- Model of ACR OR ACM time and True Or False For observation for any time of acute rejection

#### .white[Proposed Models to Investigate the Metrics]

*Cross Validated Random Forest survival*
- By applying the rfs package

*Cross validated Lasso Regression Model*
-  By applying the cv.glmnet function the glmnet package

*Cross validated Logistic Regression Model*
- By applying the cv.glmnet function from the glmnet package

*Cox Regressional model utilising Principal component analysis*
-  By applying the prcomp function
